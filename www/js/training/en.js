Read on.</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/svg/2-forex-raining-man.svg\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<h3>History has proven that during financial crisis:</h3>\n\t<ul><li>The stock market declines</li><li>The real estate transactions freeze</li><li>The retail sector may suffer high losses or even bankruptcy</li></ul>\n\t<p>If your predictions are correct, then Forex can remain profitable even in the worst of times because currencies are always traded in pairs. When the value of one currency declines, the value of the other one rises.</p>\n\t<p>Pretty awesome, huh? You can earn, regardless of whether the market is trending up or down, but if your prediction is wrong, you can lose as much.</p>\n\t<h2>Trade while lying in a hammock</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/svg/3-work-while-in-hammock.svg\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>Access the trading world from anywhere while lying in a hammock! All you need is a computer and/or a smartphone and an Internet connection. Many successful Forex traders use advanced trading apps on their iPhone or Android smartphones and tablets. So choose the lifestyle that suits your trading goals and trade the way you want to.</p>\n\t<h2>START WITH $250</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/svg/4-start-trading-with-usd100.svg\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>Unlike any other financial market, Forex has low entry costs due to the large number of market participants. Also, the increasing competition among brokers lowers their commissions and consequently transaction costs. Currently, Forex is the most cost-effective market for retail investors. In Forex, you can start trading with $100-$2000. As you start to get a stronger grasp of forex trading and risk management, invest more. Remember that losses are a part of the game even for experienced traders, but the more you learn, the less likely you will make rookie mistakes.</p>\n\t<h2>EASY RULES</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/svg/5-easy-rules.svg\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>In 2023 there are more than 45,000 publicly traded companies worldwide and although there are many currencies in the forex market, traders work mainly with just 8.</p>\n\t<p>In addition, the value of currencies is affected by significantly less factors than the value of stocks. As a result, it\'s relatively easier for you to follow and predict changes in Forex market.</p>\n\t<h2>SELL AT ANY TIME</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/svg/6-money-stack-sell-any-time.svg\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>With a daily turnover of more than $6.6 trillion, forex is the most liquid financial market. There is always a buyer when you want to sell and there is always a seller when you want to buy. This is highly reassuring!

    "text": "<audio id=\"audio\" src=\"play-goforex.mp3\" autostart=\"false\" ></audio><p>The foreign exchange market determines the relative values of different currencies. The price of a currency is actually a reflection of what the market thinks about the current and future condition of a country's economy compared to other economies.</p>\n\t<p>When you buy U.S. dollars with British pounds, you are in fact buying shares of the U.S. economy, expecting the U.S. economy to outperform the U.K. economy.</p>\n\t<img src=\"img/svg/2-uk-usa-trade-example.svg\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<expand><expand-head><h2>SEE EXAMPLE</h2></expand-head><expand-content><p>For example, the US Dollar has been strengthening in relation to the British pound in recent months. A strategic and well-informed forex trader would anticipate this trend between the two currency pairs a few months in advance. He would then sell his pounds to purchase dollars while the exchange rate still favored the pound. As the value of the dollar increased over time, the number of US dollars he owned would gradually be worth a larger number of pounds. Today, he could then sell his US dollars at their increased value and buy back British pounds for less than their original selling price, making a handsome net profit.</p\n\t</expand-content></expand><p>In short, the main task of a forex trader is to buy a currency pair when exchange rates are expected to rise in the future, then sell a currency pair when its exchange rate is expected to fall.</p>\n\t<h2>Currency pairs</h2>\n  <img src=\"img/svg/ani_11_trump_2.svg\" />\n\t<p>Currency pairs are divided into majors, crosses and exotics. Majors represent developed economies and are highly liquid with low spreads. They are stable and predictable in relation to other asset classes such as small cap equities and stocks.</p>\n  <img src=\"img/svg/ani_11_trump_3.svg\" />\n  <p>Majors include EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, USD/CHF, USD/CAD, AUD/USD and NZD/USD. </p>\n  <img src=\"img/svg/4-popular-crosses-forex.svg\" />\n  <p>Crosses do not include the U.S dollar in the currency pair and are ideal for diversification. Crosses include GBP/JPY, EUR/GBP, CAD/JPY, AUD/CAD, EUR/AUD and NZD/JPY. </p>\n\t<img src=\"img/svg/5-popular-exotics-forex.svg\" />\n  <p>Exotics include a currency from a developing country, so they are extremely illiquid with very high spreads. Examples include the Hong Kong dollar (HKD), the Singapore dollar (SGD), the Russian Ruble (RUB), the Indian Rupee (INR) and more. Also, the currencies of the Scandinavian countries are considered exotic, although they represent developed economies.</p>\n  <p>There are many traders who successfully trade other types of pairs too, but a general rule of thumb for beginners is to start off trading the most common currency pairs.</p>\n\t<h2>HOW TO READ THE QUOTES?</h2>\n\t<div style=\"position:relative;\"><img src=\"img/svg/6-how-to-read-quotes.svg\" class=\"full\"/>\n<div style=\"width: 100%; height: 200px; position: absolute; bottom: 0;\" onclick=\"PlaySound()\"></div></div>\n\t<p>Currency pair quotes may seem confusing at first, but reading them is actually pretty straightforward. In the example above, the EUR/USD quote of 1.2302 shows how much one euro (EUR) is worth in US dollars (USD). This means that one euro is worth 1.2302 US dollars. The base currency is always the first one listed in the pairing.</p>\n\t<h2>PIP</h2>\n\t<p>Price Interest Point represents the smallest change in a currency pair. Typically, it is the fourth decimal point, although many brokers quote using the fifth decimal. However, the fifth decimal doesn’t really affect the price as it changes really quickly. </p>\n\t<img src=\"img/svg/7-what-is-pip.svg\" class=\"space\"/>\n\t<p>Currency pairs that include the U.S. dollar, a pip is 1/10,000 of a dollar, whereas when the currency pair includes the yen, a pip is 1/100 of a yen because the yen is closer in value to 1/100 of other major currencies.</p>\n\n\t<h2>SPREAD</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/svg/8-how-to-read-spread.svg\" class=\"full\" />\n\tThe difference between the sell quote and the buy quote (in pips). The higher the liquidity of a currency, the lower the spread. \n\t<h2>WHAT INFLUENCES CURRENCY RATES</h2>\n\t<h3>Central banks</h3><ul><li>Interest rates</li><li>Quantitative easing</li></ul>\n\t<h3>National Economy</h3><ul><li>GDP, inflation, deflation</li><li>Trade balance reports</li><li>Employment statistics</li></ul><h3>Politics</h3><ul><li>Stability of government</li><li>Public statements</li><li>Change of officials</li><li>Military conflicts</li></ul><br/>\n\t<p>In Forex, all information is transparent and instantly available, and, therefore, trading decisions are based on real facts and not just inside information like in the case of the stock market. Also, economic factors like the interest rates and inflation are accurately and instantly released by reliable resources like Reuters, Economist, Bloomberg etc., but also from governmental agencies. Economic data can really cause market fluctuations and forex brokers can take advantage of the situation to realize a profit.</p>\n\t<expand><expand-head><h2>SEE EXAMPLE</h2></expand-head><expand-content>\n\t<h3>EXAMPLE – HOW THE EURO RATE DROPPED</h3>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/2-basics4.jpg\" class=\"space full\" />\n\t<ol><li>Prime Minister of Greece announces referendum.</li><li>ECB announces a new president</li><li>Berlusconi resigns</li><li>Central banks agree to increase the liquidity of financial transactions</li><li>The EU cannot agree upon changes in the treaty</li></ol>\n\t</expand-content></expand>\n\t<h2>LEVERAGE – THE GOLDEN TOOL</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/svg/9-leverage.svg\" />\n\t<p>Through the use of leverage, you can invest a small amount of money while trading larger positions through a loan from your broker. When the trade closes, your broker deposits the money into his account. All processes are made automatically through the trading platform. Leverage is presented in the form of a multiplier that shows how much larger the open position is against the margin (the actual investment amount) when it is opened.</p>\n\t<p>The typical options of leverage in forex include 50:1, 100:1 and 200:1. In the US the maximum allowed leverage is 50:1. Anything above 200:1 is considered very high risk. Here's an example to illustrate how leverage works. In order to open a $10,000 position you can use a margin (investment) of $200 with a leverage of 1:50 ($200 x 50 = $10,000).</p>\n\t<expand><expand-head><h2>SEE EXAMPLE</h2></expand-head><expand-content><p>Below are two options of a $100 investment in BUY order:<br> A) With leverage of 1:20<br> B) With leverage of 1:200</p> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/9-leverage-example1.svg\" class=\"full\" /> \n\t<p>With a $100 investment in Option A, you are able to trade with US$2,000. If the currency value changes by as little as 30 pips in your favor, you can make a profit of US$6. The ROI of this investment is 6%.</p> \n\t<p>By investing the same $100 with Option B, you can trade with $20,000 and make a $60 profit. After closing, the position of your balance would be $160. The ROI of this investment is 60%. By increasing leverage, you increase your ROI.</p>\n\t<p>As sweet as it sounds, remember that leverage works in both directions. You could easily lose money if currency changes in the opposite direction. Using the example above, if the currency value drops by the same 0.0030 (30 pips), your account balance would suffer a loss. </p>\n\t<img src=\"img/svg/9-leverage-example2.svg\" class=\"full\" />\n\t</expand-content></expand><p>Using leverage allows you to increase the potential of realizing a profit between 50 and 200 times faster but the potential for loss is the same. We recommend using caution and starting off slow.</p>\n\t<h3 class=\"upper\">HOW TO CHANGE THE LEVERAGE</h3>\n\t<img src=\"img/svg/10-how-to-change-leverage.svg\" class=\"space\" />\n\tThe best platforms enable you to edit the leverage level and margin of each position to suit your personal risk-reward strategy with just one click. \n\t<h3>TIPS AND WARNINGS</h3>\n\t<ul><li>Never risk all of your money in one transaction. Experienced pros typically recommended diversifying your risk by spreading out around 5% of your total deposit per trade.</li><li>Start slow at first, so that you can build both experience and confidence in trading. You can always increase leverage and profit more as you learn the ins and outs of forex.</li><li>Set up a stop loss order, which tells your broker to sell a currency if it hits a certain price. While it's great to think positive and trust your trading strategy to open trades, it's just as important to consider the worst scenario and determine how much you are comfortable losing on each trade.</li><li>The leverage available on positions carried over the weekend may vary. For trades left open over the weekend, make sure your margin is sufficient to avoid a margin closeout.</li></ul>",

    "text": "<p>Forex is like a game of tug of war, as there is a constant battle between two parties at all times.</p> \n\t<p>While most people are familiar with Wall Street's raging bull symbolizing aggressive financial optimism and prosperity, few understand the bear representing pessimism and declining markets.</p> \n\t<h3>To comprehend the charts better, this section will answer 3 questions:</h3> \n\t<ul> \n\t<li>How to separate and handle “Bearish” and “Bullish” positions?</li> \n\t<li>How to read “Linear”, “Bar” and “Japanese candlestick” charts?</li> \n\t<li>How to recognize and benefit from future market trends?</li> \n\t</ul> \n\t<h2>Bull</h2> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/2-bull.svg\" class=\"full\" /> \n\t<p>A bullish or bull market describes a rising market that shows confidence and stability. Typically employment is high and the economy is strong, convincing brokers and investors of an upward market trend. The term comes from bull fights when an opponent is thrown up into the air with the bull's horns. </p> \n\t<p>When bulls outweigh bears, indicators turn to the color green, representing a larger demand for currency and thus increasing its value.</p> \n\t<p>So when you spot a bullish market, you want to buy currencies for less and sell for a higher currency price.</p> \n\t<h2>Bear</h2> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/3-bear.svg\" class=\"full\" /> \n\t<p>On the other side of the spectrum is a bearish or bear market. This declining market creates insecurity among brokers and investors who expect trends to go downward. The term is used to signify that the market behaves the same way as a bear in fight by pushing down to the ground. A bearish market is visualized in charts with the color red.</p> \n\t<p>When you feel confident that the bear will soon overtake the bull and expect currency rates to fall, you would sell short. This process may seem unclear for many people, so let's break it down. The simplified idea is that you borrow currency from your broker and when the currency price falls, you pay back the broker at the lower price, thus making a profit on the difference.  The process is completely automated. We recommend trying the Sell - Short option in our trading simulator to see exactly how it works.</p> \n\t<h2>Line chart</h2> \n\t<p>The line chart is the most basic chart type and is created by connecting several data points together with a line. The line chart can give you a good idea of how the currency price changes over a given time frame and allows you to keep an accurate track record of historical closing prices.</p> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/4-line-chart.svg\" class=\"full\" /> \n\t<p>This figure illustrates how the line chart looks on the trading platform.</p> \n\t<h2>Bar chart</h2> \n\t<p>The bar chart is used in technical analysis to indicate the highest price a security traded at during the day as well as the lowest price at the top and the bottom of the vertical line respectively. The closing price is displayed on the right side of the bar, and the opening price is shown on the left side of the bar. A single bar represents price action for a certain time frame, in this case the daily bar represents one day of price action.</p> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/5-bar-chart-explained.svg\" class=\"full\"  /> \n\t<ol><li>Descending trend (red/bearish ), the day's highest price</li><li>Ascending trend (green/bullish), the day's highest price</li><li>Opening price (open)</li> <li>Closing price (close)</li> <li>Lowest price</li></ol> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/6-bar-chart.svg\" class=\"full\" /> \n\t<p>This figure illustrates how the bar chart looks on the trading platform.</p> \n\t<h2>Candlestick chart</h2> \n\tThe candlestick chart resembles the bar chart, but the major difference is that it puts more emphasis on the relationship between opening and closing prices in a particular time frame. \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/7-japanese-candle-stick-explained.svg\" class=\"full\" /> \n\t<div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-50\"><fieldset><legend> \n\t<span class=\"bearish\">Bearish</span> – The price decreases \n\t</legend><ol> \n\t<li>Highest price \n\t<ul><li>a.

Closing price</li> \n\t<li>d. Opening price</li></ul></li> \n\t<li>Lowest price \n\t</li></ul></fieldset></div></div> \n\t \n\t<p>The dual nature of the financial market is portrayed in the Bullish and Bearish market.</p> \n\t<p>Bullish (bull market) is the rising market that shows confidence and stability and convinces brokers and investors that the trend will be upward. The term is used to signify that the market fights like when the bulls fight and throw their opponents up in the air with their horns.</p> \n\t<p>Bearish (bear market) is the declining market that creates insecurity to brokers and investors who expect that the trend will be downward. The term is used to signify that the market goes down like when the bears fight, their opponents are being put down.</p> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/8-japanese-candle-stick.svg\" class=\"full\" /> \n\t<p>This figure illustrates how the candlestick chart looks on the trading platform.</p> \n\t<h2>MULTIPLE TIME FRAME ANALYSIS</h2> \n\t<p>The market can be analyzed in several time frames: minutes, hours, days, weeks, even months. It may often seem that these indicators are contradictory, but they aren’t! You just need to combine the readings. Analyses of longer time periods indicate particular trends, ignoring minor accidental changes, whereas daily and hourly charts are used for choosing the perfect timing to open and close a position.</p>  \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/9-multiple-time-frame.svg\" class=\"space\" /> \n\t<p>Let's have a look at the daily chart  above. What do most novice traders do when they see such a curve? They assume that it’s the beginning of a downward trend and bid on the drop of the currency exchange rate. They’re wrong! \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/10-multiple-time-frame.svg\" class=\"space\" /> \n\t<p>Now let’s look at the same currency over a longer period of time (above). We see that the  day shift was a short term fluctuation and that the trend is bullish (upward) and not the other way around as one might consider by looking at a smaller time frame. \n\t<p><strong>PROFESSIONAL TRADERS USE THE DAILY CHARTS TO SPOT TRENDS AND MINUTE CHARTS TO SET THE ENTRY & EXIT POINTS.</strong></p> \n\t<h2>TRENDS</h2> \n\t<p>Charts help you understand the overall direction a currency pair is going. The data points show either upward or downward trends, which helps you decide when to buy or sell. Here are the most common trends:</p> \n\t<h3>Upward trend</h3> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/11-upward-trend.svg\" class=\"full\" /> \n\t<p>An upward trend indicates that the price of a currency is increasing. You know this is happening when both the peak and the trough is higher than the ones before it, creating a formal uptrend. By evaluating charts and trends, you can forecast uptrends and trade appropriately to realize a profit. </p> \n\t<h3>Downtrend</h3> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/12-downward-trend.svg\" class=\"full\" /> \n\t<p>A downtrend in currency occurs when the value decreases and becomes a formal downtrend when each data point is lower than the last. Downtrends can last for any length of time, ranging between minutes and years. The longer they last, the greater they impact your portfolio. By recognizing a downtrend early on, you can avoid buying currencies with declining values. Downtrends are also a good time for selling short. </p> \n\t<h3>Horizontal trend</h3> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/13-sideward-horizontal-trend.svg\" class=\"full\" /> \n\t<p>A horizontal trend indicates very little movement in currency values. While individual peaks and troughs may occur, the overall trajectory is linear. Some experts argue that a horizontal trend is not its own course, but rather, the absence of an upward or downward trend. When you're just starting off in forex trading, play it safe by avoiding currencies on a hortizontal trend because it may be difficult to identify which direction it will go. </p> \n\t<h3>Trend Length</h3> \n\t<p>There are three different categories of trend duration in forex trading:  </p> \n\t<ol><li>Short-term trends (a few hours)</li> \n\t<li>Intermediate-term trends (2-3 weeks)</li> \n\t<li>Long-term trends (several months or longer)</li></ol> \n\t<p>Then length of trend duration also corresponds to the investment length for profit. </p> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/14-trend-lenght.svg\" class=\"full\" /> \n\t<p style=\"color: #dd695d; margin-top: 1.5em;\"><strong>DON’T RISK GOING AGAINST TREND!</strong></p> \n\t<p>For example, if the charts tell you that the overall market is down and the short selling potentials are much higher than buying (going long), just focus on shorting. Don’t go against the trend, you are just taking unnecessary risk if you do that. </p>",

Be careful with figures that look too positive</h3> \n\t<p>A positive profit margin does not always point to a lasting success, so it is important to investigate how well the trader managed over a longer time frame. Test first with a virtual trading account.</p> \n\t<h3>2. Allocate a maximum of 20% per trade</h3> \n\t<p>It's wise not to put all of your money in one trade. Diversify risk by only trading 5-20% of your total deposit.</p> \n\t<h3>3. Talk with a pro</h3> \n\t<p>Try to start a conversation with an experienced trader, either online or in person. Ask what amount they recommend for you to copy their trades, what stop loss they recommend, and any other questions you may have. With millions of users worldwide you may find that your neighbor is one hell of a trader and later go out for a coffee to discuss future investment options.</p> \n\t<h3>4. Avoid “young accounts” or new accounts.</h3> \n\t<p>If you want your investments to be safe, it is recommended to copy traders with at least 1 year of experience.</p> \n\t<h3>5. Check the results frequently</h3> \n\t<p>Sometimes traders lose control by opening too many positions at once. Regularly follow all portfolios to be sure that your traders cut losses short and let profits run. Also remember about setting up Copy-Stop-Loss order.</p>\n\t<h2>COPY TRADING EXAMPLE</h2> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/forex_copytrade_example.svg\" class=\"full\" /> \n\t<p>The proportion between transferred funds to the particular trader and the initial capital of the trader is $5:$1,000 or 1:200. If the trader invests $200 or 20% in a transaction, then $5 will be invested from your account by copying his behavior, which is 20% of your $25. Naturally, if the trader you copy earns, you also earn a profit. Therefore, if the trader earns $20 when investing $200 (which is 10%), then you earn $0.50 when investing $5. </p>",

Naturally, if the trader you copy earns, you also earn a profit. Therefore, if the trader earns $20 when investing $200 (which is 10%), then you earn $0.50 when investing $5. </p>",

In this lesson, we'll guide you through the best times to trade each asset class.</p> \n\t<p>These insights will help you make informed decisions to maximise profits and minimise risk. </p> \n\t<h2>THE WINDOW OF<br> OPPORTUNITY</h2> \n\t<p>There is a specific period widely regarded as the prime time for trading all assets. In short, that is when there is the most activity in the markets, with traders from around the world participating in the buzz. </p> \n\t<tradingtimes></tradingtimes> \n\t<besttime></besttime> \n\t<p>The overlap between the London and New York sessions, which occurs from 8 am to 12 pm ET, is the most active and liquid time of the day for trading currencies, stocks, and other assets. This period is characterised by high volumes and significant volatility, which means there are more opportunities for you to enter and exit trades.</p> \n\t<expand><expand-head><h2>WHAT IS A SESSION?</h2></expand-head> \n\t<expand-content> \n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_5_1.png\" /> \n<p>The markets are divided into three major trading sessions: <b>Asian session, European session, North American session.</b></p> \n\t<p>Each session is named after the financial centres that are most active during that period. </p> \n\t<p>The Asian session includes financial centres in Tokyo, Singapore, and Sydney.</p> \n\t<p>European session includes financial centres in London, Frankfurt, and Zurich.</p> \n\t<p>North American session includes financial centres in New York, Toronto, and Chicago.</p> \n\t</expand-content></expand> \n\t<p>Now let's get into specific market opening and closing times for each asset class.</p> \n\t<h2>FOREX</h2> \n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_5_2.png\" /> \n<p>The flexibility of forex trading hours is a significant advantage, allowing you access the market from anywhere in the world on weekdays.</p> \n\t<p>For those unable to trade during the London-NewYork overlap, off-peak hours can still offer some advantages.</p> \n\t<p>Trading during the Asian session can be beneficial if you trade the yen or other Asian currencies, and major news releases outside of peak trading hours can create big moves despite lower market activity.</p> \n\t<h2>STOCKS/INDICES </h2> \n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_5_3.png\" /> \n<p>The first hour after the stock market opens is widely considered the most profitable time for stock trading. During this time, there is increased volatility and volume as traders react to news and events that occurred overnight or before the market opened. Similarly, the last hour before the market closes is also a time when traders position themselves for the next trading day.</p> \n\t<p>Indices, such as the S&P 500 and FTSE 100, are also traded during stock market hours. If you want to trade these indices, you can only do so during the stock market hours of their respective exchanges. For example, the S&P 500 index is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and the FTSE 100 index is traded on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).</p> \n\t<h2>CRYPTOS</h2> \n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_5_4.png\" /> \n<p>One of the major attractions of crypto trading is its round-the-clock availability. However, it's worth noting that the volume and volatility of the crypto markets can vary depending on the time of day, day of the week, and news releases that impact the industry.</p> \n\t<p>Typically, the highest volume and volatility in the crypto market can be observed on weekends when traditional markets are closed. During this time, traders tend to turn to the cryptocurrency market for trading opportunities.</p> \n\t<h2>COMMODITIES</h2> \n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_5_5.png\" /> \n<p>Commodities such as gold, oil, and agricultural products have different peak trading hours. For instance, gold tends to be more volatile during the overlap of the European and US sessions (8 am to 2 pm ET), while oil prices typically fluctuate the most during US market hours when major reports are released. Here are some examples of such reports:</p> \n\t<ul><li>Weekly Petroleum Status Report by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA): <b>Released every Wednesday at 10:30 am ET.</b></li><li>Monthly Oil Market Report from the International Energy Agency (IEA): <b>Usually released on the 12th of each month, but the exact release date can vary.</b></li><li>Monthly Oil Market Report from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC): <b>Usually released around the 10th to 15th of each month, but the exact release date can vary.</b></li></ul> \n\t<h2>WHEN NOT TO TRADE</h2> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/4-when-NOT-trade-forex.svg\" /> \n<p>As a beginner, it is advisable to avoid periods of low liquidity, such as Friday afternoons and holidays, and major events like Christmas or Primetime TV events. It is also important to remember that major economic reports and news releases can cause significant volatility and unpredictability in the markets.</p> \n\t<p>However, if you feel ready to trade during peak times and big price moves, it is crucial to be mindful of your emotional and mental state when trading. Emotions such as anger, frustration, or exhaustion can negatively impact your decision-making and lead to poor results. </p> \n\t<p><b>Therefore, it is essential to avoid trading when you are feeling emotional.</b></p> \n\t",

    "text": "<h2>1. START GRADUALLY</h2> \n\tDon’t open many positions at the same time. It’s better to choose fewer positions, but weigh each of them carefully. \n\t<h2>2. STOP – LOSS ORDER</h2> \n\tPeople often forget to limit their loss and therefore have to step out of the game very soon. With the Stop – Loss Order, you will be able to control the situation, if the rates change unexpectedly. \n\t<h2>3. RULE OF 1/6</h2> \n\tSpecialists advise against risking more than 1/6 of your free capital when you aren’t completely confident. \n\t<h2>4. STICK TO THE PLAN</h2> \n\tGood traders have their own plan, and the best make an effort to hold onto it. Some prefer daily transactions, whereas others like long-term strategies. You should keep it steady! Write your plan on a paper and follow it systematically. Write down the prices of each transaction and why you selected the particular strategy in order to analyze it later. \n\t<h2>5. MULTIPLE TIME FRAMES</h2> \n\tDifferentiate the time frames of analysis: weekly charts are used to observe trends; hourly and minute charts are used to determine the perfect timing to open and close positions.  \n\t<h2>6. DON’T STOP THE PROFIT</h2> \n\tA common mistake beginners make is closing the transaction too soon, thus not taking advantage of the full profit potential. Trends last longer than they might seem at first! \n\t<h2>7. DON’T PLAY AGAINST THE TREND</h2> \n\tTransactions against a trend usually result in loss. Wait for an evident trend and then make your move! \n\t<h2>8. IF IN DOUBT, FOLLOW THE GURU</h2> \n\tIf you still aren’t confident about your decisions, choose a platform that lets you follow gurus and copy their transactions.  \n\t<h2>9. TRENDS HAVE MOMENTUM</h2> \n\tBeginners often don’t know when a trend starts and don’t use trends in their favor. Trends have momentum, although a momentum strategy requires a solid exit to protect profits. \n\t<h2>10. CLOSE THE UNSUCCESSFUL </h2> \n\tDon’t hold unsuccessful positions open for a long time. Experience shows that it’s best to close them early and move on to others.",

Find a broker that is regulated by government institutions.</h3> \n\t<p>You'll rest easy knowing that there is a monitoring process for your broker's activity.</p> \n\t<p>The following agencies regulate investment brokers:</p> \n\t<ul><li>U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)</li> \n\t<li>Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (Cysec)</li> \n\t<li>Markets in Financial Instruments Directive of Europe (MiFlD)</li> \n\t<li>National Futures Association of the U.S. (NFA)</li> \n\t<li>Financial Conduct Authority of UK (FCA)</li></ul><br> \n\t<h3>2. Don't rely on awards and accolades.</h3> \n\t<p>Companies might boast honors such as \"Most Trusted Broker of the Year\" on their website. But remember, just because it's on the Internet doesn't mean it's true!</p> \n\t<h3>3. Check out their analytical tools.</h3> \n\t<p>Before making a final decision, ask for a free demo account. That way you can test the platform and check for speed, and ease of use for trading, setting up stop losses, and changing your leverage.</p> \n\t<h3>4. Understand how fees work.</h3> \n\t<p>Broker fees are typically either spread based or commission based. Brokers charging spread based fees are ofter better suited for beginners because they have low minimum deposits. They make money on the spread, which, you may remember, is the difference between a currency pair's bid price and ask price. Commission based fees, on the other hand, charge based on the size of the trade. A 1k lot might have a $0.08 charge, a 10k lot would then have a $0.80 charge, and a 1,000k lot would have an $80 charge. Minimum deposits with these brokers usually run between $2,000 and $10,000.</p> \n\t<p><strong>For example, opening and closing trade of $200 with a leverage of 1:50 would cost the trader:</strong></p> \n\t<ol><li>Spread-based fee: $3 (spread of three pips)</li> \n\t<li>Commission-based fee: $1.42</li></ol><br> \n\t<p>Obviously, commission structure and fees vary depending on the individual broker, so be sure to thoroughly research and compare your options.</p> \n\t<p>Other fees to be aware of include holding an open position over the weekend and overnight rollover fees.</p> \n\t<h3>5. Analyze their customer service</h3> \n\t<p>Determine if a broker has good customer service by talking to it's support center. If the staff is knowledgable and easy to get in touch with, then this could be a good match. Also evaluate the broker's deposit and withdrawal options. The more options the better for you because it gives you more leeway in managing your money.</p> \n\t<h3>6. Consider the deposit amount and leverage</h3> \n\t<p>Broker deposit minimums range between $10 and $2,000, and sometimes even more. The amount of money you want to start off trading might affect which broker you choose. You should also consider the maximum leverage, which is usually 1:200. Some brokers offer 1:400 but it starts to get complicated and potentially risky once you hit a 1:500 leverage so be sure to proceed with caution.</p> \n\t<expand-content></expand></li> \n\t</ul> \n\t<p><strong>Stay safe and trade wise. Happy Pips!</strong></p>",

In other words, by performing fundamental analysis.</p> \n\t<p>Basically, <strong>all fundamentals are indicators of where investors intend to put their money and which currencies will be influenced as a result</strong>. In this section you will learn how to trade Forex by recognizing the major market-moving events under 4 categories:</p> \n\t<ol> \n\t<li><strong>Local economy</strong> - inflation, unemployment, trade balance</li> \n\t<li><strong>Central banks</strong> - interest rate adjustments, quantitative easing, capital controls</li> \n\t<li><strong>Political stability</strong> - elections, referendums, military conflicts</li> \n\t<li><strong>Natural disasters</strong> - tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes</li> \n\t</ol> \n\t<expand><expand-head><h2>SEE IMPORTANT TIPS</h2></expand-head> \n\t<expand-content> \n\t<ol> \n\t<li>Most economic reports share the same principle: <strong>Actual figure > Forecast figure = Good for currency</strong> (exceptions being certain negative reports like jobless claims, or a higher than expected rise in inflation).</li> \n\t<li>The currency rates often start moving because of expectations and forecasts before the actual data comes out or the event occurs.</li> \n\t<li>All factors are relative, therefore always compare them between the two countries of a currency pair.</li> \n\t<li>Uncertainty is negative for any financial market. So if uncertainty rises, get ready for safe haven assets such as Japanese Yen, Gold and Silver to rise.</li> \n\t</ol> \n\t</expand-content></expand> \n\t<h2 style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">#1 INFLATION RATE</h2> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/ani_48_shop.svg\" class=\"space\"/> \n\t<p>Inflation is defined as a general increase in prices of services and goods, such as milk and bread. It is a natural byproduct of a rising economy. Inflation rises when there is more money to be spent, which creates more demand for goods and services, which in turn push prices higher.</p> \n\t<p>Inflation is measured over a period of time as a percentage. For example, inflation or the Consumer Price Index (CPI) reports from national economies usually report inflation rate on a month over month or year over year basis. <strong>A stable inflation rate of 2 - 3%, which is usually followed by many advanced economies in the world, is considered to be healthy as it signals a rising economy.</strong></p> \n\t<expand><expand-head><h2>SEE EXAMPLE</h2></expand-head> \n\t<expand-content> \n\t<h3><strong>Example 1 - Inflation compared between two economies.</strong></h3> \n\t<p>In a hypothetical scenario, let's assume that the inflation rate in the UK is 3% and the inflation rate in the EU is 0.4%. This means that over the last one year, the rise in the cost of goods and services in the UK is much higher than in the EU.</p> \n\t<p>When inflation rate is high or above a predetermined level set by the central bank, it signals a tightening cycle in interest rates as well. Therefore, higher inflation leads to higher interest rates, which in turn pushes the exchange rate higher.</p> \n\t<p>Rising exchange rates for the domestic currency results in less competitive costing for exporters, which eventually leads to a slowdown in inflation. It is therefore important to understand that central banks use interest rates as a lever to increase or slow down the inflation rate to ensure that an economy does not overheat or cool too quickly. Furthermore, by increasing interest rates, central banks can reduce the amount of cash in the economy and control rising inflation.</p>  \n\t<h3><strong>Example 2 - CPI rise and impact on currency rate</strong></h2> \n\t<p>In September 2016, UK's annual inflation rate jumped 1%, compared to a 0.6% increase in August. The increase in CPI was the highest since November 2014. Inflation increased as the British pound fell sharply after the June Brexit referendum which saw the currency weaken in value. A cheaper currency meant higher prices for imported goods (like gasoline or textiles) which essentially translates to higher inflation.</p> \n\t<p>The increase in inflation was welcomed by the Bank of England which later said that interest rates in the UK could rise if inflation continued to increase at a steady pace to the central bank’s 2% inflation target rate.</p> \n\t<p>This shifted the view on the British pound which managed to rise slightly after the CPI data was released.</p> \n\t</expand-content></expand> \n\t<h2 style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">#2 EMPLOYMENT SITUATION</h2> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/ani_43_bear_needs_job.svg\" class=\"space\"/> \n\t<p>One way of analyzing the level of employment is looking at the “unemployment rate”, which shows the total workforce of a nation that was unemployed during the reported period. However, unemployment rate is relatively slow to change, therefore traders focus on Nonfarm Employment Change report (when trading USD), which shows how many jobs in the US, excluding farming jobs, were created in reported period. <strong>The unemployment rate is one of few data releases which work the other way around</strong>. Less people not working is better than more people not working.</p> \n\t<strong>Unemployment rate increasing = bad for economy = currency value decreases.</strong></h3> \n\t<strong>Unemployment rate decreasing = good for economy = currency value rises.</strong></h3> \n\t<expand><expand-head><h2>SEE EXAMPLE</h2></expand-head> \n\t<expand-content> \n\t<p>In June 2016, U.S. network provider Verizon had a comeback of about 35 000 employees after they had gone on strike previously. It was one of the positive causes towards U.S. Nonfarm Employment Change report, that showed 287 000 thousand job increase over the forecasted 175,000 figure. At the same time U.S. unemployment rate increased from 4.7% to 4.9%, which is a negative indicator. In the report, the Nonfarm Employment Change was more important, as the U.S. dollar (USD) rose from 99.910 to 100.629 against Japanese Yen (JPY).</p> \n\t</expand-content></expand> \n\t<h2 style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">#3 TRADE BALANCE</h2> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/ani_45_ships.svg\" class=\"space\"/> \n\t<p>You should follow monthly trade balance data to find the difference from the previous actual balance of trade, to find which countries have a trade deficit or a trade surplus.</p> \n\t<strong>Imports < exports = good for economy</strong><br> \n\t<p>When a country imports less than what it exports, it results in a trade surplus and this increases demand for the currency, resulting in <strong>higher currency value</strong>.</p> \n\t<strong>Imports > exports = bad for economy</strong><br> \n\t<p>Conversely, when a country imports more than what it exports, it results in a trade deficit and this decreases demand for the currency, resulting in <strong>lower currency value</strong>. This is the #1 reason why you will always hear from politicians to support locally made products.</p> \n\t<expand><expand-head><h2>SEE EXAMPLE</h2></expand-head> \n\t<expand-content> \n\t<p>In February 2016, after seven months of posting a trade deficit, New Zealand revealed a 5.9% increase in exports due to China demanding more milk products and cherries. The Kiwi (NZD/USD) experienced a +1.10% increase, while NZD/CNY jumped by 1.26%. Going long (buying) on NZD against USD or CNY was the proper trader’s reaction upon the announcement.</p> \n\t</expand-content></expand> \n\t<h2 style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">#4 INTEREST RATES</h2> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/ani_53_walking.svg\" class=\"space\"/> \n\t<p>Interest rates are controlled by central bank (a government appointed independent agency) that aims to maintain a healthy economy by controlling inflation (advanced economies like US, UK, Europe, target a 2% inflation rate, while emerging markets target a 4% - 6% inflation rate) levels. To achieve such objectives, central banks frequently adjust their interest rates.</p> \n\t<expand><expand-head><h2 class=\"custom\">SEE WORLD CENTRAL BANK'S ANNOUNCEMENT FREQUENCY</h2></expand-head> \n\t<expand-content>\n\t<strong>Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ)</strong> - NZD (New Zealand Dollar) - 8 times a year<br> \n\t<strong>US Federal Reserve System (The Fed)</strong> - USD (U.S. Dollar) - 8 times a year<br> \n\t<strong>Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)</strong> - AUD (Australian Dollar) - 11 times a year<br> \n\t<strong>Bank of Canada (BoC)</strong> - CAD (Canadian Dollar) - 8 times a year<br> \n\t<strong>Bank of Japan (BoJ)</strong> - JPY (Japanese Yen) - 8 times a year<br> \n\t<strong>Swiss National Bank (SNB)</strong> - CHF (Swiss Franc) - Quarterly<br> \n\t<strong>Bank of England (BoE)</strong> - GBP (British Pound) - 8 times a year<br> \n\t<strong>European Central Bank (ECB)</strong> - EUR (Euro) - 8 times a year<br> \n\t</expand-content></expand> \n\t<p>When interest rates are cut, it means that central banks want you to warm the economy by spending money by taking loans rather than saving. Popular effects of interest rate cuts are:</p>\n\t<ul> \n\t<li>Increases inflation, decreases currency exchange rate</li> \n\t<li>Cheaper cost of borrowing (ex: lower cost of mortgages or loans)</li> \n\t<li>Real estate prices rise due to increase in cheap credit</li> \n\t<li>Exports become more competitive due the lower currency exchange rate</li> \n\t</ul> \n\t<p>Obviously, if interest rates are increased, all effects are opposite.</p>\n\t<table><tr><td style=\"border: 2px solid black; padding: 6px;\"><p><strong>Stimulate economy<span class=\"arrow-down-black\"></span>decrease interest rates<span class=\"arrow-down-black\"></span>currency rate weakens</strong></p></td>\n\t<td style=\"border: 2px solid black; padding: 6px;\"><p><strong>Slow down economy<span class=\"arrow-down-black\"></span>increase interest rates<span class=\"arrow-down-black\"></span>currency rate getting stronger</strong></td></tr></table>\n\t<expand><expand-head><h2>SEE EXAMPLE</h2></expand-head> \n\t<expand-content> \n\t<p>In  August 2016 - the first time since 2009, Bank of England policymakers voted for an interest rate cut from 0.5% to 0.25% in order to prevent a recession and boost the economy after the vote to leave the European Union. After the announcement, the pound (GBP) fell by 1.5% against the greenback (USD).  In this case, if you opened a 100$ trade with 10x leverage and went short on GBPUSD, you would easily earn 15$ (just by watching the event and trading). Therefore, always be aware of the central bank’s current sentiments about interest rate policy adjustments.</p>\n\t</expand-content></expand> \n\t<h2 style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">#5 QUANTITATIVE EASING</h2> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/ani_41_moneyprint.svg\" class=\"space\"/> \n\t<p>During and after recessions, such as the financial crisis of 2008-2009, interest rate cuts alone weren’t powerful enough to recover an economy. This is when central banks announced Quantitative Easing, which means supplying commercial banks with ultra-cheap funds, which they can pass on (lend) to businesses, homeowners and individuals to stimulate economic growth. In other words, with QE programs central banks print new money, thus increasing its supply out of thin air.</p> \n\t<p><strong>Historically, forecasts of QE have sent currency values down.</strong></p> \n\t<expand><expand-head><h2>SEE EXAMPLE</h2></expand-head> \n\t<expand-content> \n\t<p>European Central Bank started QE in March 2015. More than a year later, at an ECB press conference in 20th October 2016, Mario Draghi (the president of ECB) comments served as a hint of extending the QE program to March 2017. After his comments, the EUR fell by 0.45% against USD. Remember that it wasn't a fact but only a thought by the head of ECB that influenced the price movement.</p> \n\t</expand-content></expand> \n\t<h2 style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">#6 COUNTRY'S POLITICS</h2> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/ani_49_debates.svg\" class=\"space\"/> \n\t<p>Political stability of a nation is an essential aspect for investors. When there is instability in terms of leadership or the policies undertaken by the government, it leads to investors shunning the currency of the nation in question. </p> \n\t<p>As a result of the uncertainty, investors pull out on account of the subsequent instability, leaving the currency to weaken. Instability comes in many forms. From general elections to referendums that have a large impact on trade, taxes and foreign policy to military conflicts which scare investors away from the nations involved.</p> \n\t<table><tr><td style=\"border: 2px solid black; padding: 6px;\"><p><strong>Unstable, uncertain policies have anegative  effect on a currency</strong></p></td>\n\t<td style=\"border: 2px solid black; padding: 6px;\"><p><strong>Stability, predictable and friendly policies are good for a currency</strong></td></tr></table>\n\t<expand><expand-head><h2>SEE EXAMPLE</h2></expand-head> \n\t<expand-content> \n\t<h3>Example 1: Brexit Referendum Uncertainty impact on GBP</h3> \n\t<p>On Thursday, June 23, 2016 the UK held a national referendum to vote whether to remain in the EU or to exit from the economic bloc. Of the nearly 30 million people who voted in the referendum, 52% voted <strong>to leave the EU</strong>, which took the world by <strong>surprise</strong>.</p> \n\t<p>GBP fell by 5.97% against EUR after the surprising result as there were <strong>a lot more questions than answers</strong>, such as what happens to UK's trade relationship with the EU or the topic of free movement between the UK and the EU. The Bank of England responded with implementing a Quantitative Easing program, along with a rate cut, to further stoke consumer demand.As a result consumer sales rose because of increasing purchasing power which eventually led to even more inflation. In such a volatile situation, with a weakening currency, traders would be advised to short the currency in question and take advantage of the emerging trend.</p> \n\t<h3>Example 2: Election Uncertainty impact on Mexican Peso</h3> \n\t<p>The Mexican peso (MXN) fell by over 15% since January 1st 2016 until September 20th. The peso then fell by another 12% after the recently concluded US general elections on November 8th 2016 as it became clear that Republican candidate Donald J. Trump emerged as the 45th president of the United States.</p> \n\t<p>The reason for the decline in the Mexican peso was due to the unfriendly policies outlined by Trump during his election campaign</p> \n\t<p>For example, Trump said that he would “<strong>build a wall around the US-Mexican border</strong>” and “<strong>deport millions of illegal Mexican immigrants</strong>” in the country.</p> \n\t<p>Besides immigration, Trump also promised to “<strong>bring jobs back to America</strong>”, meaning that US companies such as Carrier, and some auto-makers will be forced to relocate their manufacturing plants from Mexico, back to the U.S.</p> \n\t<p>The policies proposed by Trump were clearly a threat to Mexico both economically and politically which became a reality after his election victory. The Mexican peso fell as a result. For example, Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim is reported to have lost over $5.1 billion on account of the peso falling 14% on November 9th 2016.</p> \n\t</expand-content></expand> \n\t<h2 style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">#7 NATURAL DISASTERS</h2> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/ani_46_catastrophic.svg\" class=\"space\"/> \n\t<p>When you hear news of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tsunamis, volcanic disruptions, beware of a volatile currency exchange market. The volatility can increase, if the event includes loss of strategic resource supply, or points to huge restoration expenses for that country.</p> \n\t<expand><expand-head><h2>SEE EXAMPLE</h2></expand-head> \n\t<expand-content> \n\t<p>On February 2011, New Zealand was struck by a 6.3 magnitude strong earthquake, which resulted in more than 105 deaths and about 15 billion New Zealand dollars in infrastructure losses. As a result, NZD/USD currency pair plunged from 0.7634 to 0.7550. Traders who reacted quickly to the event made profits on short NZD/USD positions. Take note, that price reversals may occur suddenly if other central banks intervene to help the damaged nation, as was the case when a tsunami hit Japan in 2011.</p> \n\t</expand-content></expand>",

These legends have proved there’s a huge profit potential in both markets.</p> \n\t<p>However, many beginners are often confused in which of the two markets to invest in. Besides the overall market simplicity and $6.6 trillion a day in volume, Forex serves 3 huge benefits for traders with less experience and smaller available trading funds.</p> \n\t<h2 style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">#1 BUY OR SELL ANY TIME</h2> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/ani_40_stretching.svg\" class=\"space\"/> \n\t<p><strong>Just like Jean-Claude Van Damme, Forex offers more flexibility.</strong></p> \n\t<p>Imagine you went short on the USD/JPY pair (bought JPY, sold USD) and bought Nippon Life Insurance Inc. (Japan’s insurance company) shares at the same time. If afterwards Japan is struck by an earthquake and tsunami, both investments will quickly lose value. In this case it will be much easier to cut losses on USD/JPY currency pair in comparison to Nippon shares.</p> \n\t<p>That's because currencies are traded in pairs. Even if no one is ready to cover your short on the  USD/JPY at the time, someone will be selling, for example, EUR/JPY to fill in your stop loss order. On the other hand, it's very unlikely someone will buy Nippon Life Insurance Inc. shares, therefore chance of selling them in the market will be less likely.</p> \n\t<h2 style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">#2 TRADING 24 HOURS A DAY</h2> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/ani_35_day_night.svg\" class=\"space\"/> \n\t<p><strong>Unlike stocks, you can trade any currency pair 120 hours a week (24 hours/day, 5 days/week)</strong>. For example Google stocks (GOOG) can be traded only 40 hours a week during US trading hours only. Furthermore, if your stocks are damaged during after-market hours, cutting losses on your stock will be a huge problem as price will gap on the next trading day.</p> \n\t<h2 style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">#3 HIGHER LEVERAGE</h2> \n\t<p><strong>ROI (Return on Investment) in forex is higher than in the stock market.</strong></p> \n\t<p>Imagine you have a $2,000 trading capital. You decide to invest 50% in stocks and 50% in Forex, while using the highest leverage available. In most cases, brokers will offer you a maximum leverage of 1:5 (5X) for stocks and 1:200 (200X) for currencies. Therefore you will be able to control 5,000$ (1,000$ x 5) in stock market and 200,000$ (1,000$ x 200) in Forex. Let’s assume both investments resulted with 5% profit:</p> \n\t<ul><li><strong>Stocks:</strong> 1,000$ + (5,000$ x 0,05) = 1,250$ <strong>(+250$ profit)</strong></li> \n\t<li><strong>Forex:</strong> 1,000$ + (200,000$ x 0,05) = 11,000$ <strong>(+10,000$ profit)</strong></li></ul> \n\t<p><strong>Bear in mind, that this example only illustrates how identical deposit significantly affect the potential return of investment and risk.</strong></p>",

You can trade it too, but before you do, you must know the 3 main characteristics of Bitcoin.</p><p>*72% of retail CFD accounts lose money</p> \n\t<h2 style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">#1 COMPLETELY DIGITAL</h2> \n\t<p>Don’t be fooled by pictures - there are no physical Bitcoins that you can put in your wallet. This currency is completely digital, as people around the world are using software programs that follow a mathematical formula to produce (mine) Bitcoins. </p> \n\t<p>Initially, Bitcoin was designed to have a limited supply of 21 million Bitcoins with estimates that the last Bitcoin will be mined in year 2140. However, the main aspect of Bitcoin is it’s decentralized value - no single institution controls the Bitcoin network, which makes online payments easier, cheaper and untraceable.</p> \n\t<h2 style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">#2 DECENTRALIZED</h2> \n\t<p>Since no central bank controls it, Bitcoin’s value cannot be artificially changed with, for example, interest rate cuts or quantitative easing. Because of that, the value of Bitcoin is determined by true supply and demand and makes it easier for you to predict when investors will increase the demand for Bitcoin. In other words, less fundamental factors simplify Bitcoin’s market analysis and your trading decisions.</p> \n\t<h2 style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">#3 SIMILAR TO TRADING GOLD</h2> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/ani_52_two_houses.svg\" class=\"space\"/> \n\t<p>Look at Bitcoin as Gold (commodity), because it shares the same principle: <strong>limited supply + growing demand = increasing price</strong>. For this reason, <strong>investors tend to use Bitcoin as the second safe-haven after Gold, especially when currency markets experience uncertainty during risky events</strong>. For example, both 2016 Brexit vote and Trump’s predominance in 2016 U.S. elections where times of uncertainty about the GBP and USD future value. During both events, Bitcoin’s value grew roughly by 4%.</p> \n\t<p>Remember, that the cryptocurrency market is quickly growing since it was introduced in the year 2008. Every time you hear news, especially forecasts about major developments, beware of Bitcoin’s value shifts.</p>",

Big investment sizes (>20% of your tradeable capital) and leverage (>30X) exposes you to “fear of losing” and “greed of winning” emotions, which are the root causes for most beginners blowing their account within the first month of trading. <strong>Trade smaller positions, for example 5% with 10X leverage</strong>, to stay emotionally disciplined and to ensure you won’t lose all account equity after a few unsuccessful trades.</p> \n\t<h2 style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">#2 GRADUAL GROWTH</h2> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/ani_50_moneyhouse.svg\" class=\"space\"/> \n\t<p>Most Forex books and gurus will tell you, that every trader should apply no less than 1:3 risk:reward ratio, which basically means risking 1$ (stop loss) for every 3$ (take profit), to profit even when every second trade is a failure.</p> \n\t<p>However, this mathematician’s theory is irrelevant in real life. <strong>Even if you take 1$ profit, while risking $3, you win</strong>. There will always be trading opportunities, therefore <strong>learn to take profits regularly</strong> no matter what the risk:reward ratio is. In other words, grow your account’s equity just like houses are built - brick by brick, profit by profit.</p> \n\t<h2 style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">#3 DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO</h2> \n\t<img src=\"img/svg/ani_39_book.svg\" class=\"space\"/> \n\t<p>There’s a saying that <strong>“if you learn Forex, you can trade anything”</strong>. And we suggest you do! Especially when you get a clear trading signal from any other market. For example, <strong>it’s far better to trade Gold with confidence instead of Forex with plain hope</strong>. Stay curious while reading financial news and the economic calendar - you can always study and add new positions to trading watchlist. </p> \n\t<p>Best of all, every broker in our dynamic <a href=\"#/tab/top\">Top brokers list</a> supports trading of Currencies, Commodities, Stocks and Bitcoin. Therefore you won’t need to sign up elsewhere, when great trade opportunities arise from any of the markets.</p> \n\t<p>Follow these rules and a become successful trader we would be proud of!<br>Happy Trading!</p>",

Always go over real-time reports to make sure the fund you’ve chosen is performing positively. </p>\n<h3>#2 Start or stop at any time</h3>\n<p>Because your money isn’t locked in, as it would be with classical exchange traded funds, you can change your investment strategy at any time.</p>",

It\'s the foundation of accurate price analysis, and the first step towards achieving success in the market. </p>\n\t<p>Trading charts provide a detailed historical account of how prices have fluctuated over time. We\'ve found that mastering just two chart types is all you need to trade successfuly</p>\n\t<h2>FOR LONG TERM TRADERS</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_19_1.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>The line chart is a classic chart type that is favoured by long-term investors seeking a broad overview of price trends. Created by connecting closing prices with a line, it offers a simple yet effective visual representation of market movements that is easy to understand.</p>\n\t<p>If your goal is to invest in stocks or indices over the long-term, the line chart is an excellent choice. </p>\n\t<h2>FOR SHORT TERM TRADERS</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_19_2.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>For traders seeking a detailed view of price action, the candlestick chart is a game-changer. It offers up to 5x more detail than the line chart in the same timeframe, making it a must-have tool for identifying key patterns and trends</p>\n\t<p>It places greater emphasis on the relationship between opening and closing prices within a particular timeframe. </p><img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_19_3.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t\n\t<p>In later lessons you will learn winning trading strategies and high accuracy candle patterns. To ensure positive results, you must first learn to interpret what each candlestick shows you. </p>\n\t<h2>CANDLESTICK ANATOMY</h2><img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_19_4.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t\n\t<p>It might still seem a bit confusing, but don\'t worry, we\'re almost there! There\'s just one last crucial ingredient that ties the story of candlesticks together</p>\n\t<h2>TIME FRAMES EXPLAINED</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_19_5.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>Candlestick openings and closings are time frame-dependent. For example, on a 5-minute timeframe, a new candlestick opens and closes every 5 minutes, with the high and low reflecting the highest and lowest prices reached within that 5-minute interval. </p>\n\t<p>However, regardless of the time frame, the same price action is being displayed, just from a different angle.</p>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_19_6.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>Try switching between various time frames in our trading simulator. Shorter time frames means faster action and quicker decision-making, longer time frames allow you to observe the price action at a laid-back pace. Next up you\'ll learn the two main forces of the market.</p>",

This lesson teaches you a few fundamental concepts to help you pick the side right more often.</p>\n\t<h2>BEASTS OF THE FINANCE WORLD </h2>\n\t<p>In trading lingo, buyers and sellers are referred to as bulls or bears. You\'ll hear these terms often so let\'s dive deeper.</p>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_20_1.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>The terms bulls and bears are also used to describe the primary market sentiment, either of an individual asset or the market as a whole.</p>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_20_2.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>By definition a bear market is a when the price declines 20% or more over at least a two-month period. On the flip side bull markets begin when assets rise at least 20% from their lows. </p>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_20_3.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>Should you worry about losing > 40% in the next bear market? Not at all! Trading is perhaps the only skill which let\'s you make a profit even when the whole economy is failing. You\'ll learn to do that very soon.</p>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_20_4.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>Sir John M. Templeton knew the financial opportunities found in bear markets. That\'s because he also understood the underlying principle of why prices constantly fluctuate in the markets. It\'s time for you to properly prepare by learning those same mechanisms.</p>\n\t<h2>THE FORCE BENEATH PRICE MOVEMENTS</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_20_5.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>During a bull market, high demand for an asset pushes prices upward, while low supply of the asset limits the number of units available for purchase. Conversely, in a bear market, prices fall due to low demand and a high supply of the asset available for purchase.</p>\n\t<h2>HOW TRADERS INFLUENCE SUPPLY AND DEMAND </h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_20_6.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p><strong>How sellers create supply</strong> - When traders feel unsure and negative about BTC due to news or data, they start selling their BTC. To attract buyers, sellers must first lower the price + the excess supply BTC reduces its value, causing the price to fall.</p>\n\t<p><strong>How buyers drive demand</strong> - Positive news and economic data about BTC increases demand as buyers become hopeful and are willing to pay more for it, leading to a rise in price + sellers can then sell their BTC for a higher price.</p>\n\t<h2>THE BOTTOM LINE</h2>\n\t<p>Rather than just relying on headlines, you should consider how market news and fundamental data might impact the underlying supply and demand. Now let\'s learn about <strong>trends!</strong></p>\n\t",

    "text": "<p>Analysing trends is the easiest way to see the balance between supply and demand shifting in real-time. Besides that, trends are major money making opportunities. If the prices weren\'t trending, traders would have no opportunity to make a profit.</p>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_21_1.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>This lesson will give you the skills to identify trends across various timeframes, as well as spot the tell tale signs of when a trend reversal might happen. Let\'s begin with:</p>\n\t<h2>3 KINDS OF MARKET TRENDS</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_21_2.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p><strong>#1</strong> - Last more than a year and are the strongest, predominant trends. <strong>Always know the direction of a primary trend.</strong></p>\n\t<p><strong>#2</strong> - Last a few weeks and are usually corrections of the primary trend. <strong>A good opportunity to open positions against the primary trend!</strong></p>\n\t<p><strong>#3</strong> - Usually last less than a month and offer opportunities for short-term traders.</p>\n\t<p>Trends can be identified visually, simply seeing the price making higher highs or lower lows, but the most effective method is drawing an accurate trend line. </p>\n\t<h2>HOW TO DRAW A TREND LINE</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_21_3.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>Bravo, you\'ve got a trend line, but not a very reliable one, because it\'s yet to be tested. A trend line gains significance when the price tests it multiple times.</p>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_21_4.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>With a basic trend line you can identify the direction of the market across different time frames. In addition, a trend line can help you spot a trend reversal in advance.</p>\n\t<h2>PREDICTING REVERSALS</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_21_5.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>No matter how strong a trend is it will, inevitably reverse at some point. You can have a 7 year bull market where the primary trend is a strong uptrend, and even then, a bear market comes sooner or later. Reversals can be profitable, if you can predict them accurately. Here\'s how. </p>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_21_6.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>Shortening intervals between the “tests” is reliable signal that the opposite side is gaining momentum and the trend line will likely break soon. A trend reversal usually follows this scenario:</p>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_21_7.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p><strong>#1 Trend line gets broken</strong>, but the move has not yet gathered strength.</p>\n\t<p><strong>#2 Buyers fail to get the price back above the trend</strong>, this a called “retest” of the trend line. </p>\n\t<p><strong>#3 The trend reverses</strong> and a new trend starts in the opposite direction.</p>\n\t<p>In later lessons you will learn how to trade trend line touches using support and resistance levels and how to confirm reversals using a very reliable tool - the volume indicator.</p>\n\t<p>Now let\'s learn the specifics of buying and selling.</p>\n\t",

This lesson will explain how you can make money in both falling and rising markets with these two options.</p>\n\t<h2>IF YOU EXPECT THE PRICE WILL RISE</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_22_1.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>When going long, or simply buying, you buy an asset from the market, and wait for it\'s value to rise. </p>\n\t<p>When you close the trade it\'s automatically sold back to the market and you profit the difference. </p>\n\t<h2>IF YOU EXPECT THE PRICE WILL FALL</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_22_2.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>On the flip side, when you expect that the price will fall, you can short-sell instead and make a profit even when the asset is losing value. It\'s common for beginners to scratch their head when they think about short-selling.</p>\n\t<p>We get it! Selling an asset that you don\'t own doesn\'t make any sense, so here\'s a brief explanation.</p>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_22_3.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>In the example above, let\'s imagine that you expect a stock will fall from $15 to $5 by the end of the day, so you decide to sell one share. When you click “sell” in your trading platform, you actually first borrow the asset from the broker and then sell it. You don\'t owe $15, you owe the asset. So when the price falls, you buy the asset back for $5, return it to the broker and keep the $10 as your profit.</p>\n\t<p>The process may seem complex, but rest assured. It\'s fully automated and very easy. Try short-selling assets in our trading simulator and see for yourself.</p>\n\t",

    "text": "<p>If you don\'t manage risk when trading, sooner or later you will lose big. While you can\'t remove risk completely, you can follow just one simple rule to control your losses and maximise profit as best as possible.</p>\n\t<h2>NEVER RISK MORE THAN 1% </h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_23_1.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>The example above, illustrates how losing 1% requires just a tiny amount more gain to break even. If you lose more it get\'s exponentially harder just to get back to where you started. </p>\n\t<p>Let\'s say you start trading with $1000. By following the 1% risk rule, the maximum you can lose in a single trade would be $10(1% from $1000). </p>\n\t<p>With this rule you can be sure that single bad trade never wipes out your account. Here\'s how you enforce it.</p>\n\t<h2>A SAFE EMERGENCY EXIT</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_23_2.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>A stop loss order automatically closes a trade if the market moves against you. If you set stop-loss to - 1% of your trading account it means can lose 100 trades in a row, before you “lose everything”. Granted, such a losing streak is highly unlikely with the knowledge you have learned already. </p>\n\t<p>If you want full control of your losses, and a maximal chance at profits, always set the stop-loss to 1%. There is another tool that goes hand in hand with the stop-loss.</p>\n\t<h2>PROTECTING YOUR PROFIT</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_23_3.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>Take profit order functions similarly to a stop loss. In this case, it automatically closes the trade when it hits your profit target. Beginners often doubt the necessity of using take profit with questions like: </p>\n\t<p><strong>“Why should I close a winning trade?”</strong></p>\n\t<p>A logical question, but first remember this: as long as the trade is open, any profit is hypothetical only. Markets can reverse at any moment and with a take profit order, you can stay in control and secure your gains before it happens. </p>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_23_4.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>Finally, we will examine how using a combination of stop-loss and take-profit orders can lead to higher profitability in the long run, even if you lose the majority of your trades.</p>\n\t<h2>RISK/REWARD RATIOS </h2>\n\t<p>Losing is a part of this game. Even the best traders in the world lose thousands of trades but still end up making tremendous money in the long run. That\'s because when they lose they do so in a controlled manner. </p>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_23_5.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>It\'s done by setting the stop-loss(risk) to take profit(reward) ratio so that you always win a bit more than you lose. </p>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_23_6.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>When using 3:1 risk ratio you only need to get 3 out of every 10 trades right and you\'re making money consistently. Not that difficult to be honest. Here are the most common R/R ratios and their required win rate for profitability</p>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_23_7.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>We\'ll do our best to make sure you win more than just 3, but first, go ahead and practice setting the stop-loss and take profit in the simulator.</p>\n\t",

    "text": "<p>Have you ever heard of support and resistance(S/R)? If not, it\'s time to pay attention. This is arguably the most important tool of technical chart analysis. So, let\'s dive into it!</p>\n\t<h2>WHAT ARE S/R LEVELS?</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_24_1.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>Support and resistance are price areas at which buying and selling pressures are strong enough to prevent the price from moving further.</p>\n\t<p>When there are many buyers at a certain price, it creates a \"support\" level that stops the price from going lower. Similarly, high selling interest at a certain price forms a resistance level.</p>\n\t<h2>THREE TYPES OF S/R LEVELS</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_24_2.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>Ask any profitable trader, horizontal   S/R levels are the backbone of technical analysis! If you learn to visually identify these key areas of where the market tends to reverse, you will start to find easy trading opportunities often. Here\'s another variation of these levels.</p>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_24_3.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>What sounds better? Investing $50 into a stock or $47,58? Your psychology is wired to pick the $50 option because it\'s easier to understand. Similarly, traders often set buy and sell orders at round numbers such as $50, 100, $1000 etc. Thus these levels can represent important milestones that the price must overcome. This increased trader activity turns them into S/R levels where the price is likely to reverse. Lastly, here\'s another way to use trend lines. </p>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_24_4.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>Trend lines can also serve as S/R areas. In the example above, the two trend lines form a channel. If you find a strong trend, these are some of the easiest trades you can take. Simply enter a buy or short trade and set the take-profit order at the opposite trend line. </p>\n\t<h2>3 STEPS TO FIND THE PERFECT S/R LEVEL</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_24_5.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_24_6.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_24_7.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<h2>WHAT IF THE LEVEL BREAKS?</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_24_8.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>Lastly, it\'s common that support and resistance levels can switch roles. In the example above, the selling pressure overcame the buying pressure, causing the levels to switch roles, or in other words “flip”. Thus the previous support level, now becomes the resistance. If it breaks again, it can become a support level in the future. </p>\n\t<p>Head over to the chart and get good at finding tradable S/R levels. We know of professional traders who produce tremendous gains by relying only on support and resistance for 80% of their trades. Or you can continue learning about another fascinating way to predict where the price could go - using chart patterns! </p>\n\t",

In this lesson, you will discover 15 meticulously selected chart patterns with precise entry and exit points for trades.</p>\n\t<p>Chart patterns are great predictors for where the price might move next, so we curated only those with the highest statistical probabilities. Let\'s dive in!</p>\n\t<h2>MOST IMPORTANT:<br>REVERSAL PATTERNS</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_25_1.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>Reversal patterns tend to change the direction of a trend, thus they are are often seen on bigger time frames, such as daily or weekly charts.</p>\n\t<p>Remember, this is true for all analysis: the bigger the time frame, the stronger the pattern, trend, support or resistance level and so on. </p>\n\t<h2>A PAUSE IN THE TREND:<br>CONTINUATION PATTERNS</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_25_2.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>Unlike reversal patterns, continuations usually don\'t result in a directional change. It\'s best to view them as a brief pause in the trend. Thus, if you missed the initial trend, these patterns can serve as a last-minute entry point before it resumes.</p>\n\t<p>Before we cover the last pattern group. Let\'s explore how you can measure the profit target of any chart patters.</p>\n\t<h2>WHERE TO TAKE PROFIT IN PATTERN TRADE?</h2>\n\t<p>The bullet-proof method is to measure the size of the chart pattern at it\'s widest point, and use that as guideline for setting take profit.</p>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_25_3.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>Using this principle already takes care of the “reward” part when using a 3:1 risk ratio. All that is left for you is to adjust the stop-loss accordingly.</p>\n\t<p>Lastly let\'s explore the third pattern group that looks similar to wedges and pennants, but has one distinct difference</p>\n\t<h2>TRIANGLE PATTERNS</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_25_4.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>It\'s obvious that triangles look very similar to bullish and bearish pennants, but unlike those patterns, triangles usually form over longer timeframes such as 1d or 1w, and the main difference is that they lack clear directional bias. </p>\n\t<p>This means that even historical data can\'t accurately predict where the price is likely to move as it breaks out of the triangle. So how do we go about predicting the direction? You\'ll find the answer in the upcoming lesson.</p>\n\t",

Let\'s get into it.</p>\n\t<h2>#1 PICK A TIMEFRAME AND IDENTIFY THE TREND</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_30_1.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<h2>#2 LOOK FOR KEY MARKET LEVELS</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_30_2.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<h2>#3 IDENTIFY A CHART PATTERN</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_30_3.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<h2>#4 LOOK AT INDICATORS</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_30_4.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<h2>#5 CONFIRM WITH THE VOLUME INDICATOR</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_30_5.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<h2>#6 NEVER FORGET ABOUT RISK MANAGEMENT</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_30_6.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>What you just saw, is called <strong>the top down approach</strong>. We started with basic elements like identifying the trend and finding clues about its potential movement. Then we simply added other signals to confirm our belief that the price might fall. </p>\n\t<p>When it did, we waited for the daily candlestick to close below the broken support level as an extra confirmation, and only then, we entered a profitable short trade. This is how you should approach trading, if you want to succeed.</p>\n\t<p>Next up we will explore a few trading styles to help you find what suits your your personality best.</p>\n\t",

    "text": "<p>Trading is not a one-size-fits-all skill. You are here to learn and test <strong>what works for you</strong> without risking real money. To help you do that successfully, it is best to pick a single trading style and stick to it. </p>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_31_1.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>This lesson will help you choose one of the four main trading styles so that you can head to the charts and trade in a way that is compatible with your personality and circumstances. </p>\n\t<h2>TRADER STYLES EXPLAINED </h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_31_2.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>Unfortunately, this chart doesn\'t offer the full picture. You get that some styles require more effort than others, but that\'s about it. Here\'s the whole story and what it means for you.</p>\n\t<h2>SCALPING</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_31_3.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>Scalpers trade fast and often(5 - 10 trades per day). The goal is to add up small wins over the course of the day. Since the time frames are extremely short, you don\'t need to pay attention to fundamental events or long-term trends. Often you are analysing the price action with just the basic elements such as key market levels(S/R) and candlestick patterns.</p>\n\t<h2>DAY TRADING</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_31_4.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>Day trading is all about making a few(1-3) smart decisions each day. Ideally, the first part of the day is spent on research and analysis and then the trades are opened and closed before the trading day ends. Both day trading and scalping <strong>are demanding trading styles,</strong> that require your time and focus. Fortunately, there are “slower-paced” alternatives.  </p>\n\t<h2>SWING TRADING </h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_31_5.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>Swing trading is all about conducting proper trade analysis, such as the top down approach we outlined earlier.</p>\n\t<p>This is important because you will be holding trades overnight. Which means you need utmost confidence in your prediction, so that any bad or good news won\'t change the direction of the trade while you\'re away from the charts. </p>\n\t<h2>INVESTING</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_31_6.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p><strong>If you wan\'t the quick buck, investing isn\'t for you</strong>. It will take time and discipline, and extremely thorough research before you invest in an asset. We advise you to avoid investing in anything other than a stock market index like the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones, until you have gained some experience in the markets. Successful investing really is like planting a money tree that bears fruit in the future.</p>\n\t<h2>WHAT IS YOUR GOAL? </h2>\n\t<p>It\'s important to understand what are you trying to achieve with trading.</p>\n\t<p><strong>Do you want to make 1-2% per day, but have little free time?</strong> That\'s a normal day for professional day traders and scalpers. It\'s an intense and mentally demanding way to make a living. Do you want it? </p>\n\t<p><strong>Perhaps you are more suited to make a just a few trades and make 5 - 10% a month trough swing trading?</strong> Pro swing traders opt for less overall profit but having outside the trading screen.</p>\n\t<p><strong>Or perhaps you are ok with making 7-9% a year (historical average) trough investing in a stock market index?</strong> You won\'t make money right away, but you will have less stress and more time to enjoy other things.</p>\n\t<p>It\'s important to understand and answer these questions early on and there\'s no better way to do it than heading to the simulator and finding which trading style feels right for you. </p>\n\t<p>Try to scalp a few trades. Try to day trade or perhaps invest in an index and see what\'s comfortable for you.</p>\n\t",

    "text": "<p>You have successfully mastered the foundational concepts needed to make money in the markets. Now you need to head to the simulator and use them. </p>\n\t<p>Some of you may tempted skip the simulator and head straight into real trading. We will not hold you back but you should know this:</p>\n\t<p><strong>Without any practice beforehand you will essentially be gambling in the real markets.</strong> If you accept the risks of most likely losing money, go ahead.</p>\n\t<p>If you want to do it the right way, here\'s a checklist to test your readiness.</p>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_32_1.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>Following this guideline, will yield the highest statistical odds of starting a profitable real-money trading career. </p>\n\t<p>When you\'re at a 100%, it\'s time to say goodbye to the simulator and start real trading with confidence. To ensure maximum results with minimal losses, we selected 3 easy key rules you should take with you.</p>\n\t<h2>NEVER RISK MORE THAN 1%</h2>\n\t<p>Under no circumstances should you risk more than 1% of your trading account on a trade. Here\'s what it means relative to various trading account sizes</p>\n\t<p><strong>1)$100</strong> - you can lose max $1 per trade.</p>\n\t<p><strong>2)$500</strong> - you can lose max $5 per trade.</p>\n\t<p><strong>3)$1000</strong> - you can lose max $10 per trade.</p>\n\t<h2>FOLLOW THE 5 ASSET RULE</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_32_2.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>Never trade more than 5 assets at a time, because properly analysing and trading more than 5 is very hard, and frankly - unnecessary. Even Bruce Lee knew this universal truth:</p>\n\t<p><strong>“I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.</strong></p>\n\t<p>The world\'s best traders make a fortune by trading just 1-2 instruments and you can too.</p>\n\t<h2>LESS IS ALWAYS MORE</h2>\n\t<img src=\"img/lessons/lesson_32_3.webp\" class=\"full\" />\n\t<p>New traders have a flawed belief that <strong>something more is needed.</strong> A secret strategy, a magical indicator, more money, bigger positions, more trades... the list goes on... </p>\n\t<p>In most cases, these are actually distractions that result in lower profitability. If at any point you are overwhelmed and uncertain stick to:</p>\n\t<p><strong>1 asset, 1 time frame, 1 strategy. </strong></p>\n\t<p>Remember that each trade you take you take has 50:50 odds of being profitable. Without even looking at the chart, you could be right 50% of times, so keep it simple.</p>\n\t<h2>GOOD LUCK</h2>\n\t<p><strong>\"Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity\"</strong>. This quote, by the Roman philosopher Seneca has stood the test of time trough thousands of years. It reminds us that we make our own luck. Nobody else.</p>\n\t<p>GoForex team has prepared you well, but is now up to you to go and find the opportunity you have always needed. Your trading journey starts now!</p>\n\t",
